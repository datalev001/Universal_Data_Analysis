# Data Analysis and Python Universal Functions for Data Scientists: Part 1
Unlock the Power of Python in Data Analysis 
Data science and artificial intelligence are important in shaping future career paths, emphasizing the critical role of data analysis in extracting valuable insights. Python, as a powerful tool for data analysis, encounters challenges that often require extensive code modifications. Moreover, existing Python libraries may not align directly with the needs of business scenarios, primarily focusing on data-centric aspects. This post marks the first part of a series aimed at addressing these challenges, presenting specific functions tailored for diverse data-related issues.
Note: This post is the initial installment in a multipart series. Subsequent posts will delve deeper into advanced topics, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of universal Python functions for data scientists.
In this post, I introduce a versatile set of Python-based examples, questions, and functions designed for various scenarios in data analysis. The focus is on creating, explaining, and applying these functions to tackle different challenges. The objective is to provide practical solutions that add significant value, especially for newcomers to data science. These solutions enhance efficiency and offer valuable learning experiences, contributing to the ongoing development of data analysis skills.

EDA - The Foundation of Data Science
I begin by introducing the first data analysis tool, a cornerstone for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). EDA is of paramount importance in almost every data science project, serving as the initial and crucial step in the data analysis process. The axiom "garbage in, garbage out" holds true in all data science endeavors. Here, I outline the fundamental components of EDA, universally recognized as indispensable for meeting the demands of diverse business scenarios:

Meta Data EDA
•	Column names
•	Data types
•	Shape of the dataset (number of rows and columns)
•	Identification of a unique key column (e.g., ID)
Univariate EDA
1.	Special Data 
•	Count and percentage of missing values per column
•	Identification of outliers
•	Detection of duplicated data
•	Identification of tenure data
•	Identification of ‘actual’ data types (for data conversion) 
2.	Statistics for Interval Data
•	Various statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and percentiles for numerical data
•	Various statistics and format for date and datetime data 
3.	Statistics for Categorical Data
•	Number of levels in categorical columns
•	Contents (names) of levels in categorical columns
•	Frequency (count) of each level in categorical columns
4.	General plots for Interval and Categorical Data
•	Bar, Pie (Count, Percentage) charts for categorical variables
•	Histograms, Stem and Leaf Plots, QQ Plots for interval variables
Bivariate EDA
•	Correlation analysis
•	Group-by aggregation analysis
•	Performance tracking for predictive models
•	Bivariate analysis charts: scatter plots, curves, bar charts, heatmaps, etc.
•	These components collectively provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset, enabling a solid foundation for subsequent data processing and modeling tasks. 

Data Manipulation and Cleaning based on EDA Results
In future posts, the series will expand beyond EDA to cover more comprehensive EDA components and, more importantly, delve into data manipulation and cleaning based on the insights gained from EDA. These functions will bridge the gap between analysis and actionable insights, ensuring a robust and effective data science workflow.
These components collectively provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset, establishing a solid foundation for subsequent data processing and modeling tasks. Understanding and addressing these aspects during EDA are critical for ensuring the quality and reliability of any data science project. In the following sections, each of these EDA functions will be introduced along with practical applications. Please note that for optimization in organizing these functions, some may not strictly one-on-one match the EDA functionalities outlined above, but the overall functions will cover the entire scope of EDA functionalities.
